Hi, everyone.

You are receiving this message because you are either enrolled or on the
waiting list for ECS 132, Spring 2023.

As noted in the course FAQs, this IS a math course, and the math prereqs
are vital.  One of those prereqs is linear algebra, and I have a review
for you at

https://github.com/matloff/fastLinearAlgebra

Lessons 1-5 is all you will need for this class.

Note that as mentioned yesterday, one of the goals of Quiz 0, which will
essentially be a take-home exam due the second week of class, will be to
make sure you're ready to USE linear algebra in probability/statistical
contexts.

I'm enclosing yesterday's message below.

1.  If you have not already done so, please make sure to read the FAQs
for the course,

https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132/blob/master/FAQs.md

If you have already read it, please note that I added an item about
reading at the end, and that I have clarified the math link a bit.

2.  As explained in the FAQs, we will have weekly quizzes, in-class,
using the OMSI tool.  However, THE FIRST QUIZ, Quiz 0, will essentially
be take-home.  Note the following:

a.  The purpose of Quiz 0 will be to get you used to OMSI, get up to
speed on the R language, and review linear algebra.  See the FAQs for
the link to the R tutorial (easy, designed for non-CS people).  I am
also preparing a linear algebra tutorial, to be announced soon, but
unlike the R case, this is intended as review, not new material.

b.  Quiz 0 will be posted sometime in the next couple of days, to give
you a chance to get a head start on the course if you wish.  It will be
due sometime in Week 2 of Spring.  We will start running the OMSI server
in Week 1.

3.  Our textbook will be a subset of the PDF file at

https://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/ProbStatBook.pdf

We will cover about 60-70% of that material.  I will post the exact
trimmed version of this file in the next few days.

Looking forward to working with you.

Norm Matloff
