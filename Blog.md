**Spring 2023**

**April 4, 1225**

All my old ECS 132 quizzes are available [here](https://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/OldECS132Quizzes).

**April 3, 2106**

We will soon be forming our Homework Groups. Group size is 3 or 4. If you have 1 to 3 people you would like to be in a Group with, please so inform Lan Jiang (lanjiang@ucdavis.edu) by Friday, April 7, 11:59 pm (even if you are in Dylan's section). Otherwise, Lan will assign you to a group.

Details of how the Groups work are in the [general course info doc](https://github.com/matloff/nmGeneralCourseInfo/blob/master/RulesAndProcedures.md). Note carefully that this document is vital to your success in the course, regarding homework, exams, grading and so on; please read it right away.

My earlier e-mail messages said our blog was on the machine Heather. Of course, that is incorect. The blog is the GitHub file you are now reading.

**April 3, 2048:**

Our [course syllabus](https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132/blob/master/Syllabus.md) is now ready!

**April 3, 2015:**

It may be a couple of days before we have days/times/locations for office hours. For now, if you have questions about Quiz 0, please e-mail NM on quiz content matters, or your assigned TA (see Syllabus, available later this evening) on OMSI issues.

All class announcements from this point onward will be made here in this
blog, rather than by mass e-mail.  When making a blog post, I will also
try to send a message notifying you of a new post, but may not always do
so.  You are required to read the blog at least once per day.
