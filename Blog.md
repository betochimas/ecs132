**Spring 2023**

**April 3, 2048:**

Our [course syllabus](https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132/blob/master/Syllabus.md) is now ready!

**April 3, 2015:**

It may be a couple of days before we have days/times/locations for office hours. For now, if you have questions about Quiz 0, please e-mail NM on quiz content matters, or your assigned TA (see Syllabus, available later this evening) on OMSI issues.

**April 3, 1405:**


All class announcements from this point onward will be made here in this
blog, rather than by mass e-mail.  When making a blog post, I will also
try to send a message notifying you of a new post, but may not always do
so.  You are required to read the blog at least once per day.
