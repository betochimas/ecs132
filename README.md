# ECS 132, Spring 2023

[Prof. Norman Matloff, UC Davis](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/itaa.html )

## Hello!

Spring Quarter is not too far away, looking forward to teaching the
course.

## NONTRADITIONAL teaching methods

I care deeply about teaching, and have been fortunate to have won a
couple of teaching awards.  But **my methods** are quite different from
those of my instructors.

If you are enrolled or even on the waiting list, please read
my [course FAQs](FAQs.md) to check out how the course will work.
