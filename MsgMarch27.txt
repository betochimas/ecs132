Hi, everyone.

You are receiving this message because you are either enrolled or on the
waiting list for ECS 132, Spring 2023.

You can read previous messages at

Two announcements:

1.  Our textbook is now ready, at

   https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132/blob/master/ProbStatBook132S23.pdf

Download it to your laptop computer.  You will need it there for all
quizzes other than Quiz 0.  

This version is less than half the size of the full book, which is at

   https://github.com/matloff/probstatbook

We will cover the entirety of this reduced version.

2.  After I posted Quiz 0 yesterday, I added a paragraph regarding use
of R libraries that are not in base-R.  Make sure to keep this in mind,
to avoid situations in which you fail to get credit on a quiz question
even though your code correctly uses certain libraries.
